;;; package-config.el --- Macro helpers for modules  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Helpers for installing packages.  Crafted Emacs assumes the use of
;; `package.el' for package management, thus these are built to
;; support that library.

;; `crafted-package-installer' defaults to `package-install', but can
;; be set by the user to some other installer function.

;; `crafted-package-installed-predicate' is used to check if a package
;; is already installed; it defautls to `package-installed-p', but can
;; be set by the user to some other predicate function.

;; `crafted-package-install-package' is used to install individual
;; packages, the installer and predicate functions can be passed in if
;; needed.

;; `crafted-package-install-package-list' installs packages from the
;; `package-selected-packages' list.  All `crafted-<module>-package'
;; files add packages to this list, they are not installed
;; automatically.  The user is responsible for iterating over that
;; list to install the packages, if desired.  Users are not obligated
;; to use the `crafted-<module>-package' files and may prefer to
;; manage installing packages without using any of the facilities
;; here.  Additionally, if they choose to use the
;; `crafted-<module>-package' files, they have the opportunity modify
;; the list before calling any processing occurs to install any packages
